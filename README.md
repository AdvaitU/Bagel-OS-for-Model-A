 * OWNER: Advait A. Ukidve
 * WHO?: Industrial Design student
 * DATE OF PUBLISHING: 20 April 2019
 * PURPOSE: Classroom Project
 * 
 * VERSION NO: 5
 * UPDATE: Added ability to switch between modes with a potentiometer
 * 
 * I intend for the following code to be used, edited and played around with by anyone with genuine interest in the field without any restrictions whatsoever.
 * This wasn't written for commercial purposes but may be repurposed for such in the future.
 * 
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION: The code is written as a software prototype for my unnamed minimal mobile phone for smartphone rehabilitation therapy, 
 * a classroom project at Design School. The mobile phone retains all the core functionalities of a traditional 'mobile' telephone without 
 * integrating such features considered to be addictive. The aim is to encourage people to lift their heads up from the new 'idiot boxes' 
 * of the 21st century and indulge in their surroundings, thus in hippie toungue 'reclaiming their lives'. The phone allows for calling, SMS 
 * text messaging, checking the time, setting alarms and storing and playing music.
 * 
 * 
 * COMPONENTS USED:
 * Arduino Uno R3
 * SimCom SIM800A module
 * DS1307 RTC module
 * Novel NS101 AC-DC Power Adapter (for SIM800A)
 * 10K Potentiometer (Scroll Ring)
 * Pushbuttons (x2)
 * White LED (array of 4x3)
 * Resistors (220R, 330R, 5K, 10K, etc.)
 * 9V battery and adapter with Japan Jack.
 * 4GB SanDisk Memory Card for EEPROM storage
 * Full sized SIM card (900MHz bandwidth)
 * 
 * Libraries used mentioned as comments within code.
